# Full Stack Python Flask Project Interlinked

# A fully functional CRUD blog application written in Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS

Interlinked was my first post bootcamp project I built. I learned SQLAlchemy in order to build this and it includes the following:  

* Authentication using Flask-Bcrypt 
* Users can create their own posts as well as view others 
* Users are able to interact with others posts by commenting and liking
* Users are able to follow each other
